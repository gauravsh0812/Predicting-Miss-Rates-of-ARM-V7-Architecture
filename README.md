Predicting Miss Rates of ARM V7 Architecture
======================================

A Machine Learning based model that can be used to predict the miss rate of the mobile architecture _ARM V7 Cortex_ for an application for any user speciﬁc conﬁguration i.e. data cache retention time, write Latency and write Energy. Our model is essentially a 2 stage **_Ensemble Machine Learning_** model. 
The main challenge is to cover a wide range of applications. 

This project deals with both _micro-architectural dependent and independent features_ of applications with different configuration sets to develop a well defined Machine Learning model. 

#### NOTE: The performance of the model are micro-architectural and application dependent. Hence it may vary for the different architecture and set of applications.
