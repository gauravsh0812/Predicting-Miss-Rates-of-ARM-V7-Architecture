Predicting Miss Rates of ARM V7 Architecture
======================================

A Machine Learning based model that can be used to predict the miss rate of the mobile architecture ARM V7 Cortex for an application for any user speciﬁc conﬁguration i.e. data cache retention time, write Latency and write Energy. Our model is essentially a 2 stage Ensemble Machine Learning model. 
The main challenge is to cover as many the applications along with dealing with the fact that most of these models are micro-architectural and application dependent. In our project we deal with both micro-architectural dependent and independent features in each application to develop a model as generalized as possible which can be useful when it comes to using the different applications with different conﬁguration sets.
